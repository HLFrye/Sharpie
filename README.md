## Sharpie, an F# Bot

Very much a work in progress, not complete or ready for any particular use yet.

### Goal

The goal of this project is to create a scriptable IRC bot, similar in concept to the Eggdrop bot, but with a custom DSL for scripting bot behavior.

### Current State
As of 7/14, the application is capable of connecting to a server, logging in, and saying connected by responding to PING commands, but not much else.
